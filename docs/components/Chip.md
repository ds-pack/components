# Chip

[All components/hooks](../index.md)

The Chip component is used for displaying tags and other small bits of metadata.

It supports three variants:

- `primary`
- `secondary`
- `tertiary`

It also supports custom background colors via the `bg` prop that expects a theme
path (e.g. `teal.5`), the `color` will be determined automatically for highest
contrast.
