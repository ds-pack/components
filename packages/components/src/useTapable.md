# useTapable

[All components/hooks](../README.md)

The `useTapable` hook is used to provide an object of aria- props on an element
to make it act like a `<button>`.

It takes in two arguments:

- `props` - the props object on the tapable element
- `ref` - A ref object or function

It will focus the element after it has been activated.
